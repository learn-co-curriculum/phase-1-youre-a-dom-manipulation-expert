# You're a DOM Manipulation Master

## Reflect

Remember our "Simple Liker" program. In it we saw that front end web
programming is using three "pillars" working together:

- Manipulating the DOM
- Recognizing JavaScript events
- Communicate with the server

This whole unit has been about gaining the skills required to **Manipulate the
DOM**. Since you can now update web pages using JavaScript, you can communicate
things to users like "You've liked this message" by changing the appearance of
the web page they're looking at.

## Next Step

But...obviously most people don't interact with web pages by opening up the
Chrome DevTools console and writing JavaScript commands. If we could tell the
web page to do that work when some event happens (click of an image, double
click inside of a square, etc.) we'd be closer to the web experiences that
we're already familiar with.

The important part is that you've mastered the first pillar. Two more down and
you're going to be building the rich web applications of your dreams!
